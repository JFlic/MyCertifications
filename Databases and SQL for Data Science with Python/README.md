Over winter break of 2023 I challenged myself with getting A SQL certification through IBM to forward my studies independently with data science.

In this 29-hour course I sharpened my skills on SQL functions and queries creation. I also worked with importing CSV files and cleaning data that would cause problems for data table organization down the line. 

Finally, I completed the course with a final project of taking a real-world data CSV file (Chicago Crime rates datasheet) and abstracting important data from said datasheet.

Overall, the course was very beneficial to my continued studies in data science and I'm glad I took the time to do it.
