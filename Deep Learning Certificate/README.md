# Fundamentals of Deep Learning

I obstained a certified in deep learning through Nvidia after taking a online course. 
In this course I learned how to make models using the Tensorflow library in Jupiter notebook as well as what makes a machine learning model work at the fundimental level.
For the final project to get the certification I was tasked with make a machine learning model that would make an AI that could discern the difference between pictures of cats and dogs.
Overall it was really interesting and insightfull it made me want to pursue a carrier in it.
